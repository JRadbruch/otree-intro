A student of the course was so kind to send me additional slides concerning the git workflow.

I just skimmed them but they seem to be very in-depth.

For a quick start I recommend the below Youtube channel and these slides for a deeper understanding of the process.

I also received a recommendation for different Git frontend called "Smartgit" which seems to offer an easier to use user interface than tortoise git.
